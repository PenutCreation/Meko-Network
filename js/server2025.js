  content: "All About Html #html #content <br></br>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. Developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989, HTML revolutionized the way information is shared online. This programming language forms the backbone of the internet, enabling users to access and interact with websites. HTML documents comprise a series of elements, represented by tags (<>). These tags define the structure and content of web pages, including headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, tables, and lists. HTML5, the latest version, introduced semantic elements like header, nav, and footer, enhancing web accessibility. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript complement HTML, adding visual styling and dynamic functionality. HTML's simplicity and flexibility have made it an essential skill for web developers. Its versatility enables the creation of diverse online content, from simple blogs to complex web applications. HTML-powered websites are compatible with various devices and browsers, ensuring broad accessibility. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) also relies heavily on HTML, as search engines crawl and index HTML content to rank websites. HTML continues to evolve, addressing emerging trends and technologies. HTML5 introduced support for multimedia elements, canvas, and SVG graphics. Future developments focus on improving performance, security, and accessibility. The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) and World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) collaborate to maintain and advance HTML standards. HTML's significance in shaping the web cannot be overstated. As the fundamental language of the internet, it enables communication, information sharing, and innovation. As web development advances, HTML remains an indispensable tool, empowering developers to craft engaging, user-friendly, and accessible online experiences.",

  "content": "<h4>Javascript string size limit: 256 MB for me - is it the same for all browsers?</h4><br><p>Curious about what was the maximum string length I could get in Javascript, I tested it myself, today, on my Firefox 43.0.1, running in Windows 7. I was able to construct a string with length 2^28 - 1, but when I tried to create a string with one more char, Firebug showed me the \"allocation size overflow\" error, meaning the string must be less than 256 MB. Is this the same thing for all browsers, all computers, all operational systems, or it depends? I created the following snippet to find out the limit:</p><code>(function() { strings = [\"z\"]; try { while(true) { strings.push(strings[strings.length - 1] + strings[strings.length - 1]); } } catch(err) { var k = strings.length - 2; while(k >= 0) { try { strings.push(strings[strings.length - 1] + strings[k]); k--; } catch(err) {} } console.log(\"The maximum string length is \" + strings[strings.length - 1].length); }})();</code><p>If you are running a different browser/OS, I would like to see your results. My result was The maximum string length is 268435455.</p>",
