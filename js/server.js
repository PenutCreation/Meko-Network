Join me as I take you through the incredible journey of my young bull ant colony, bull ant queen  Bezzy and bull ant worker Pub, raising their next generation of worker ants.</p> <br></br> <p>Everything seemed to be going well, with cocoons forming and anticipation building for the arrival of new workers. However, things took a heartbreaking turn when the cocoons didn't enclose, and it seemed like the colony's efforts were in vain. Determined not to give up, I decided to intervene and carefully open the cocoons, hoping to save the newborn ants inside.</p>  <br></br>  <p>Thankfully, with the help of your advice and patience, Anthony was reaccepted into the colony, proving that nature can be both harsh and forgiving.

We'll cover ALL sorts of scary stories of allegedly REAL supernatural and paranormal activity. You'll see apparitions, weird EVPS, ghost hunters, scary tiktok ghosts, and everything else within the creepy, spooky realm of the supernatural. Are you still reading? Well okay, I didn't know people read video descriptions this far down. So- there are some CREEPY dolls in this video,  and... a shadow person, or shadow man, not sure on the pronouns. A cute dog hears a LOUD evp and freaks right the f out, a YouTuber does a very interesting ghost video experiment, and then there's other scary stuff.</p><div style='left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative;  padding-bottom: 56.25%;'><div class='youtube-player' style='top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;' data-video-url='https://youtu.be/FRvbby9qIxM?si=FWqsUoMrF6-I6mPR'></div></div>",
